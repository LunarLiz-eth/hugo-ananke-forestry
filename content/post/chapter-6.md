Monday May 31-Sunday June 6  
**Sun & Moon Reading Sun in Gemini 10*-16* Moon moves from Aquarius-Taurus**  
Beginning of the week you are considering how to innovate what you create in the future based on new spiritual beliefs and thinking. Thursday Moon shifts into Aries mid-day creating an afternoon/evening energy surge that may lead to even more new ideas for the next 2 days. Expect to receive some kind of spiritual push this weekend to help solidify your new thinking.

Monday June 7- Sunday June 13  
**Sun & Moon Reading Sun in Gemini 17*-23* Moon moves from Taurus-Cancer**  
The beginning of the week you are actively making decisions on what you want to create, ultimately building to the New Moon Solar Eclipse happening around 7am EST Thursday morning. This new moon is helping you to internalize this new you that you have been trying on since the full moon lunar eclipse last month (5/26). You will be really feeling out these new mental clothes for the rest of the week with Moon in Cancer, so take not to over stress yourself. There is still time to edit, as mercury is retrograde this month and is not out of shadow until July 1.

Monday June 14- Sunday June 20  
**Sun & Moon Reading Sun in Gemini 24*-29*/Cancer 0* Moon moves from Leo-Scorpio**  
You are ready to present your new self to the world to see reactions. Be open to receiving any critiques, try not to take things too personally if people are uncertain of your new ways. Keep your new fire burning and see who shows up. You may feel a bit nit-picky with yourself mid-week, once the moon moves into Virgo, resist the urge to make changes based on the responses of others. Work on finding and protecting what balance feels like with your new way of being, itâ€™s not what it used to be.

Monday June 21- Sunday June 27  
**Sun & Moon Reading Sun in Cancer 0*-6* Moon moves from Scorpio -Aquarius**  
This week is all about protecting that new you inside and being willing to explore the full potential of what it all means. Full Moon on Thursday, in Capricorn, highlights the physical work that may need to be done now that you have mentally established new ground.Spend the rest of the week formulating your plans, writing things down, and innovating your thoughts around work and how you receive money/ self-worth/ feelings of achievement.
