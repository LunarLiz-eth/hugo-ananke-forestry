**Sun and Moon Readings for July 2021  
  
**Week of Monday June 28- Sunday July 4)  
**Sun & Moon Reading Sun in Cancer 7*-13* Moon moves from Aquarius to Taurus**   
Now that you have made your plan(s) you are feeling out the right first step. Even if you have written it down, make sure to spend some time meditating/praying on, feeling/sensing out your decision and the first step to take, spiritual guidance may come through at this time. The rest of the week is all about actively manifesting these first moves to elevate your potential now that you have made significant changes in your personal beliefs about yourself/life/ and where to move forward. The Moon moves into Aries late evening on Wednesday (around 9:15pm EST) which may create a burst of creative energy, keeping you up late. Moon in Taurus over the weekend should make for a well deserved, relaxing, and enjoyable holiday weekend. **  
  
Week of Monday July 5 - Sunday July 11**

**Sun in Cancer 13*-19* Moon moves from Taurus to Leo  
 **Once we have crawled out of our long weekend coma with the Moon in Taurus, get ready for the mind to switch into high gear. We will be feeling out all the future potentials now that Mercury is out of the shadow of it’s retrograde period. Last month we took our time reviewing our perspectives on day to day life and how to move forward in the future with new understandings and beliefs. This month, particularly this week, is all about gearing up for those changes, perhaps seeing some new ones we had not considered, and committing to them by the end of the week with the New Moon in Cancer at 18* (9:17pm EST) . We are being actively called upon by God/Source/Spirit to move forward in creating a new emotional security foundation for our future growth. After Friday it will be easier to actively pursue these plans for the future. Until then, look back at previous plans and desires and see what still resonates, and how you may be looking at the project differently now...perhaps more hopeful and less critical? 

**Week of Monday July 12-Sunday July 18  
Sun in Cancer 20*-26* Moon moves from Leo to Scorpio   
 **Get ready for a passion fueled week. The fire is being lit in so many ways, driving you towards your heart’s true desires. The Sun entering the last decan of Cancer has us seeking how we can use this passion to establish our new emotional security in the outer world and lead with our new integrity. The Moon is bolstering this actively, connecting with both Venus and Mars in Leo on Monday, opening us up to even more new goals and desires. Tuesday & Wednesday will be more about the tangible needs to get to where you’re going. Be flexible on these details Thursday/Friday and make sure you are looking at all the angles. With the Sun opposite Pluto this weekend, you may realize you need to let go of a limited belief or old control structure to help you move forward.

**Week of Monday July 19- Sunday July 25  
Sun in Cancer 27* - Leo 3* Moon moves from Scorpio to Pisces  
 **As we reach the end of this year’s transit in Cancer we are seeking to achieve mastery over our new beliefs and to start seeing the outer effects of decisions we have made for our new emotional security. The Moon in Scorpio and Sagittarius during these last few degrees is helping us hold space for the new directions to come. The Sun moves into Leo on Thursday and opens with a Full Moon at 1*, essentially checking in on how we are doing- is that new emotional security based on a new love and sense of belonging in yourself? You will be solidly answering these questions internally by the end of the week, it may mean there are still some old mental habits that need to go.

**Week of Monday July 26- Sunday August 1  
Sun in Leo 4*- 10* Moon moves from Pisces to Taurus   
 **Every year the Sun in Leo asks us to truly check in with our hearts desires, and what we may or may not be doing to support them. The first decan is all about our internal world, here the Sun is actively seeking where the heart belongs so that it can manifest that desired outcome. Monday and Tuesday you are feeling out the path you belong on, roadblocks could arise if you are not being true to yourself. The Moon moves into Aries early Wednesday (6:00am EST) morning urging you to rise and shine and take action towards your goals. The Moon in Taurus over the weekend is a great time to get any tangible projects going.
