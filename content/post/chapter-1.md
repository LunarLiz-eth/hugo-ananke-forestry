Monday November 1- Sunday November 7   
**Sun Moves from Scorpio 9*-15* Moon Moves from Virgo-Capricorn  
**Last week we explored new boundaries with ourselves. This week we will be putting those new boundaries to task in the outer world. It may be best to stick to those close to you this week as you do your initial testing, everyone asserting their own personal needs may lead to some less than trustworthy motives from any adversaries you may have.

**  
Monday (1/9*/Virgo-Libra)** Halloween frights may come a day late this year. Today, the Sun forms a YOD (more below), that will last a couple of days, with Chiron in Aries 9* and Black Moon Lilith in Gemini at 11* The Sun in Scorpio is asking you to dive deep into what lines must be drawn to heal from past wounds and conquer fears you may have around maintaining your integrity going forward. The Moon in Virgo squares Pluto, making you hyper aware of any daily activities that may need to be changed. Beware of anyone trying to sell you a false bill of goods today Mercury trines Jupiter at 22* and a T-Square with the Moon opposite Neptune, squaring Venus in Sagittarius may leave us feeling a bit too trusting and open to being taken advantage of. No major aspects after the Moon squares Venus at 1:00pm est until Moon moves into Libra at 7:00. Use this time to get detailed oriented tasks done._  
_**Tuesday (2/10*/Libra)** Today you begin to outwardly manifest your new inner trust with yourself. Boundary drawing may feel easier as you’re now more focused on protecting your needs. This will come in handy as Mercury Squares Pluto today creating an opportunity for outer world drama, disagreements, or heated debates. Expect your thinking to be challenged. A Grand Trine in air with the Moon in Libra, Black Moon Lilith in Gemini and Saturn in Aquarius may have you feeling overly chatty about your view of the future, be mindful of your audience.   
**Wednesday (3/11*/Libra)** The Sun is quincunx Black Moon Lilith today at 11* helping us to face any mental fears (False.Evidence.Appearing.Real) that make be keeping us from truly trusting ourselves on the inside. The Moon conjuncts Mercury this afternoon, assisting with clarity in communications with others, but a square to Pluto warns of smooth talkers looking to take advantage of you. A sextile to Venus this evening makes this a great night to gather with friends and loved ones. The Moon enters Scorpio around 9pm est which may have you desiring some quiet personal time after dinner.**  
Thursday (4/12*/Scorpio)New Moon 12* 5:15Pm** Expect the unexpected and plan for surprises with the Sun opposite Uranus today. New information or changes in your values are pushing you to break free from the old, helping you see clearly what you want and don’t want. Any trouble you may have had drawing lines this week will be supported with renewed clarity on the path forward. This New Moon is helping you commit to your changes once and for all, with strong support from Mars in Scorpio. Things may feel a bit chaotic today as the breakdowns happen. This story will continue to be refined over the next 2 weeks as both Mars and Mercury make the same opposition to Uranus, followed by a powerful Lunar Eclipse on the 19th.   
**Friday (5/13*/Scorpio)** Both Venus and Mercury move into new signs today bringing a change of energy to our minds and desires. Their Sextile forms the base of another YOD happening this week with the North Node (more below). The Moon trines Neptune around 5:33am est, if you’re an early riser, this is a great time to meditate on whatever new goals you might be committing to, and a good day to start with a sextile to Pluto around noon. A somewhat quiet day aspect wise means you can accomplish tasks with ease. Moon enters Sag in the evening.   
**Saturday (6/14*/Sagittarius)** With the Sun an 14* Scorpio today we will be imagining our plans for the future. Avoid going down any old story rabbit holes by planning a productive house project that reflects your desired future. The Moon sextiles Saturn in the morning giving a family feel to the weekend.  
**Sunday (7/15*/Sag) Daylight savings ends** The Moon squaring Neptune this morning may leave you feeling out of it with that extra hour, but a sextile to Jupiter brings forth some chatty energy later in the morning. A quiet aspect day today helps you get tasks accomplished for the week ahead. Moon enters Capricorn around 8pm est.

_  
_**This Week’s Aspect Pattern:** _The YOD, The Projection Figure, or The Finger of God  
_**2 Quincunx from the same planet or point, forming a sextile  
**This highly creative aspect triangle consists of two quincunxs that move through the center of the chart. These two long green lines act like antennas, picking up the inner core motivations of the native and the apex planet. These inner motivations are then projected onto the two planets forming the sextile at the base. Inner motivations are seen outwardly here, and the level of awareness available will lead to how this pattern is expressed. The two quincunxs are long decision lines that can take an entire lifetime to understand how they work together to create their outward projection. Awareness training is key to unlocking the spiritual growth that this figure provides. The apex planet of this figure points to this spiritual destiny of the native, but it is up to them to learn what their own internal desires are and why they respond in particular ways. Take a look at your own chart to see what houses are involved in this process.

**Monday November 1- Thursday November 4  
__Sun in Scorpio 9-12* Quincunx Black Moon Lilith Gemini 11* & & Chiron Aries 9*

You may be facing fears of not being able to hold yourself accountable to all of your new boundaries. It is time to heal old wounds and move on from old fears in order to move forward in your life when it comes to inner trust and spiritual growth. It is your destiny to move on and move forward.

**Monday November 8-Sunday November 14**  
_Sun Moves from Scorpio 16*-22* Moon Moves from Capricorn to Pisces_**  
**After trying out our new boundaries on the world last week, we determined where to draw the line with the outer world to maintain our new vibe. This may have led to some break ups with people, places and things. This week we are seeking out friends and allies that can help us back our new sense of self.

**Monday( 8/16*/Capricorn)** You will be feeling the love today with the Moon conjunct Venus. Use this good mood to connect with friends who are supportive of your new vibe and your new goals. The Moon squares Chiron in the early afternoon so you may be feeling some healing pains, a trine to Uranus in the late afternoon will have you feeling more excited for the future.   
**Tuesday (9/17*/ Cap)** With the Moon in Capricorn today is another good day to interact with those supportive friends. You’ll be able to see the big picture more easily and will be feeling more positive about your direction forward. The Moon sextiles Neptune and conjuncts Pluto suggesting you are more emotionally ready to close any last remaining doors or windows from your old life.**  
Wednesday (10/ 18*/ Aquarius)** With the Sun at 18* and a conjunction with Mercury and Mars nearby at 7* today, you are ready for action, and heads may roll. The Moon joins Saturn in it’s square to this dynamic duo, perhaps bringing a large caution or stop sign with it. Saturn is just making sure that you are staying connected to that bigger plan you were looking at yesterday, as things could escalate quickly with everyone on the offensive. Mercury conjunct Mars is ready to say all the things, without filter, do your best not to burn any bridges you may need later.**  
Thursday (11/ 19*/ Aquarius)** Use today to cool those jets, with the Sun at 19*, we are working towards manifesting our new sense of boundaries and trust in the outer world. With fewer aspects today this is a good time to start any new projects associated with your new big picture. The Moon conjuncts Jupiter in the afternoon, and should put you in high spirits.   
**Friday (12/20*/Pisces)** Friday brings an opportunity to get quiet with oneself. The Sun trines Neptune today bringing your intuition to the forefront. The Moon sextiles Venus and trines Mars, making this a good day to meditate on your desired goals and the steps you will take to get there.   
**Saturday (13/ 21*/ Pisces) **With the Sun at 13* and Mercury opposing Uranus today, expect some shocking new information to come to light. Take everything in a positive stride, even if you are seeing chaos, this breakdown must occur to take you to where you need to go next. Simplify and get back to what you value most. The Moon is very active today as it trines Mercury, sextiles Uranus, conjuncts Neptune AND trines the Sun- Your new soul path is waiting!**  
Sunday (14/ 22*/ Pisces-Aries)** Today is a quiet day, use it to relax and reflect. The Moon in Pisces sextiles Pluto in the morning and moves into Aries around 11am. Expect an energy boost this afternoon to help you get going on those new plans.

**This Week’s Aspect Patterns: T-Square, Small Talent Triangle, & Large Learning Triangle  
**This week, 3 patterns really dominate our skies all week, and because they are all intimately interacting together, and I’m in a bit of a learning mood, I thought I would list them all here!

  
**T-Square: Saturn square Uranus, Mercury conjunct Mars opposite Uranus**  
First up, is the most familiar pattern, one half of which has been heating up all year. Now that the Sun and his compatriots have entered Scorpio we will be feeling the effects of this T-Square until they are out of orb of Uranus. Mars will be the last to get outta dodge towards the end of the month.  
The first two planets here of course are Saturn Square Uranus, the Sun in Scorpio made its opposition last week, this week Mercury meets up with Mars from 6-7* Scorpio, creating the tension that must be released along the shorter square lines. We may be at odds with others this week as we are asserting our new claimed personal values more outwardly in our words and actions.. There may be some chaos, hurt feelings, and significant endings and beginnings happening this week, especially with the New Moon on Thursday. The Mercury Mars conjunction Squaring Mars suggests you may have a hard time holding back those true feelings about those authority figures you dislike, be mindful of your audience.(…i’m sensing a theme here….)

Large Learning Triangle: 1 Quincunx, 1 Sextile, 1 Square  
**Chiron square Venus, Venus sextile Mercury conj Mars, Mercury conj Mars quinunx Chiron**   
Mars has joined the sextile party with Mercury and Venus that began last week. They have moved on from their YOD to now both make a connection with Chiron forming a Large Learning Triangle.. The common point for all three of our aspect patterns this week is Chiron (still Retrograde) in Aries at 9*, making healing a significant theme. The square it is making to Venus is where tension or conflict is sought out with the intention of seeking a solution via the quincunx. The desire here is to get back to the harmony that exists inside of the sextile; the danger is over simplifying the solution. With Aries, Sagittarius, and Scorpio involved, it may feel like the assistance you are looking for, in order to truly claim your new sense of self is available via interactions with Martian and Mercurial style people in your life, or new people coming into your life. The challenge here is to not let other people do the work for you, and to not fall back into comfort habits that may keep you from growing. Check to see what house Scorpio is in for you for how these Martian and Mercurial energies of assistance might be showing up.

Small Talent Triangle: 2 Sextile and 1 Trine  
**Chiron sextile Saturn & Black Moon Lilith, Saturn Trine Black Moon Lilith**

The Small Talent Triangle shows us where we are developing talent over the course of our lifetime through means of absorption and adaptation. The three blue aspects create harmony with the three houses it interacts with, but because there are no red aspects in this pattern it must be activated by the outside world. The trine reflects the inner attitude where we are interested in absorbing new information which can be implemented through the two sextiles. With Chiron at the apex, the theme here again is healing, more specifically something about ourselves that has been around for a long time. The sextiles to Saturn and Black Moon Lilith suggest a fear around not being able to take control over this healing, or vice versa, Saturn could be empowering you to finally forgive (trine) those fears, thank them for what they have taught you, and move on for good. It is interesting to note that this particular pattern has been in effect most of this year with Chiron and Saturn staying in orb of their sextile. Planets and points that have moved into the first decan of Gemini have been assisting. The North Node and Mars were here in April, Venus and Mercury in May, and of course the Sun in June. Black Moon Lilith moved in at the end of July and will be in orb until the end of this month.

Monday November 15-Sunday November 21  
**Sun Moves from Scorpio 23*- Sagittarius 0* Moon Moves from Aries to Gemini  
**This week we see the outer word start to shift and change now that everyone is feeling more comfortable with their new inner sense of self. You know where to draw the line and how to maintain it, and who our new allies are that will help us in this new quest. We are now ready to tear down the old walls to make way for the future. Get ready for some exciting changes this week!

**Monday (15 / 23*/ Aries)** The week starts with the Sun squaring Jupiter in Aquarius and Venus, now in Capricorn, squaring Chiron (still retrograde). With the moon in Aries conjuncting Chiron and sextiling Saturn, you may be feeling ready to go, but you’ll likely find some kind of hold up or push back due to timing. You are opening up to finally healing those old wounds, which might leave you feeling a little vulnerable. Tomorrow is a better day to get things started.**  
Tuesday (16/ 24* / Aries)** The Sun sextiles Pluto today, giving you that “yes” you were looking for yesterday. The Moon sextiles Jupiter, helping you feel the infinite potentials that are now available that may not have existed before. A quiet afternoon aspect wise helps you get to it. Moon enters Taurus around 9:15pm est.**  
Wednesday (17/ 25*/ Taurus)** Mars makes its official opposition to Uranus today, who is still at 12*, and brings life to our New Moon intentions. Our ego is finally getting on board with our new values that assert our new identity. Be mindful of your body today, and the whole week really, as you may be moving faster than usual and could be more prone to accidents. The Moon conjuncts Uranus today highlighting these themes even more. Take caution in all actions.**  
Thursday (18/ 26*/ Taurus)** Mercury trines Neptune today and could put you in la la land. Find a creative outlet to focus your intuitive energies into. Perhaps a vision board to draw up your future? Is there an art project you’ve been wanting to start? The Moon joins the party with a sextile in the afternoon and trines Pluto later on. Hopefully, you are feeling the support and are excited for the future.

**Friday (19/ 27*/ Taurus)** Today’s Full moon, peaking around 4am est, is a Lunar Eclipse, as the Sun at 27* will make a 4* conjunction with the North Node in Gemini at 1*. We are starting to really feel like we belong in this new skin we are in. If this feels like a repetition, it’s because these changes take time. Today’s eclipse is a highlight to next year’s cycle, as they will all be on the Taurus/Scorpio Axis. We hop back into the Gemini/Sagittarius axis in our next Solar Eclipse in 2 weeks, where you will be birthing new actions to take over the next year. Consider the next two weeks a gesticulation period for all of your dreams and desires.**  
Saturday (20/ 28*/ Gemini)** The Sun at 28* is helping you manifest plans for the future_._ Mercury squares Jupiter today helping you make decisions on a grand scale on what stays and what goes. You may have a different feeling about something that you had planned last month during Mercury Retro.  
**Sunday (21/ 29*-0*/ Gemini-Cancer)** Mercury has been busy this week, but quiets down after its sextile to Pluto today. You should be feeling empowered and energized for your new story to begin. Sun at 29* means you could be faced with a test on everything you have learned during Scorpio season. You should be feeling strong to hold those new boundaries and claim your evolved identity. The Sun moves into Sagittarius around 9:30pm est you are holding space for the new story. 

**This Week’s Aspect Pattern:** _The Bijou, The Jewel_

**2 Quincunxs’, 1 Semi-Sextile 1 Sextile, 1 Trine, 1 Opposition**   
This stable, and harmonious quadrilateral pattern is a combination of a YOD and an Ambivalence Triangle, with a semisextile joining them. The two Blue aspects represent an area of general ease and harmony, where life is greatly enjoyed. The Green aspects show a pattern of thinking involved that is highly focused and easily directed. The opposition inside the figure shows an internal struggle that must be dealt with that is not generally seen by the outside.

**Wednesday November 17**  
Black Moon Lilith Quincunx Mars and Venus in Sextile (YOD), Mars Opposite Uranus, Uranus Trine Venus, Black Moon Lilith SemiSextile Uranus (and Moon)

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/R44I97HkOwmlCJLQLXOaPMGvwNyLHc0xl_DK1NY2x2KdZ_0t0Vh9dZ13k3JzipMXR3OXS8C8fWo2JSqR42hAOwZCCEJtPMO-gobQjYIKVV_jm7msLPRenJs5ymZVSR5iXgZiVKQH)

The ambivalence triangle portion of this pattern has been active for a while now, as Uranus has been in opposition with the Sun, Mercury, and now Mars. The inner struggle has certainly been highlighted, which helps to activate this particular pattern’s ability to think logically, and reason through experiences learned over time. The Blue aspects create harmony and ease, which that tension is dispersed from the opposition as quickly as possible to get back to this harmony. The danger here, of course, is that you can always slip back into a place of comfort and familiarity, and not one of growth.The YOD planet are providing us the means of this growth through knowledge over a long period of time, this is of course assists the ambivalence triangle in it’s ease, suggesting to me, there is an ease for you to finally get over some fears that are keeping you from living the life of your dreams. These fears may be appearing on a daily basis for you right now, and that is so that through repetition you will change your response. Think of it as the gateway back to the blue aspects of ease!
